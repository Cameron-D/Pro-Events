#Pro Events 1.0
Advanced calendar events.


##Installation
Upload all files in the "Upload" folder to your MyBB forum. Install and activate the plugin.

 
##Notes
It will add in any public events that were scheduled for the future (so no past events).

A task will be run every 10 minutes to notify event attendees. You can find it in /inc/tasks/notifyattendees.php.
